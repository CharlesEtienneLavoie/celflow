\title{Compute Mean Scores for Scales with Optional Reverse Scoring}
\usage{
compute_scale_means(
  data,
  scale_list,
  reverse_score = TRUE,
  rename_reversed_items = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the scales and items.}

\item{scale_list}{A character vector with the base names of the scales to be computed.}

\item{reverse_score}{A logical indicating whether to apply reverse scoring. Default is TRUE.}

\item{rename_reversed_items}{A logical indicating whether to rename reverse
scored items by replacing "reverse" with "reversed". Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the computed mean scale scores added as new columns.
}
\description{
This function computes mean scores for specified scales from a
given list. The scales are expected to be columns in the data frame starting
with a base name in the scale list. If a scale item needs to be reverse
scored (identified by "reverse" or "Reverse" in the item name), it is done
so before the mean is computed. An option allows renaming of reverse scored items.
}
\details{
For each scale in the scale list, the function first identifies the
matching columns in the data frame. Then it checks each item to see if it needs
to be reverse scored, applies reverse scoring if the reverse_score argument is TRUE,
and finally computes the mean for each scale. Messages are printed to indicate which
new variables were computed, which variables were reverse scored, and which variables
were renamed.
}
\examples{
# Assuming data.df is your data frame and scale_list is your list of scales
data.df <- compute_scale_means(data.df, scale_list, reverse_score = TRUE, rename_reversed_items = TRUE)

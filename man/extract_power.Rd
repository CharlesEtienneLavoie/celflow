\title{Extract Power Analysis Results}
\usage{
extract_power(data, target)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe containing the results of SEM simulations, typically produced by a function like \code{simulate_power}. It should include parameters estimates, p-values, and confidence intervals.}

\item{target}{A vector of strings specifying which parameters (paths) to analyze for power. These should match entries in the 'Parameter' column of the \code{data}.}
}
\value{
A dataframe summarizing the power analysis results for specified paths. Each row corresponds to a path with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item{Value}{Mean estimate of the path coefficient across simulations.}
\item{Median}{Median estimate of the path coefficient.}
\item{Power}{Proportion of simulations where the path was statistically significant (p < 0.05), excluding NA values.}
\item{\verb{Power (All Cases)}}{Proportion of simulations where the path was significant, treating NAs as non-significant.}
\item{CI_lower}{Average lower bound of the confidence interval for the path estimate.}
\item{CI_upper}{Average upper bound of the confidence interval for the path estimate.}
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the statistical power of SEM models based on simulation results, providing a detailed summary including the convergence rate of simulations.

\examples{
# Assume 'sim_results' is a dataframe from simulate_power()
target_paths <- c("M ~ X", "Y ~ M")
power_summary <- extract_power(sim_results, target_paths)

\title{Extract the Most Processed Variables from a List}
\usage{
get_processed_list(var_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{var_list}{A character vector of variable names, where the base variable name
and its processing stages are separated by dots.}
}
\value{
A character vector containing the most processed version of each base
variable name from the input list.
}
\description{
The \code{get_processed_list} function takes a character vector of variable
names and selects the most processed version of each base variable name.
The most processed version of a variable is considered to be the one with
the most suffixes (segments separated by ".")
}
\details{
This function can be useful in situations where you have multiple
versions of each variable in your dataset, and you want to work with
only the most processed version of each variable. The output order is preserved
based on the order of base variable names in the input list.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Variable list with different processing stages
var_list <- c("var1", "var1.a", "var1.a.b", "var2", "var2.a")

# Get the most processed version of each variable
processed_list <- get_processed_list(var_list)
}

\title{Filter Dataset Based on Ending Status}
\usage{
clean_ending(data, keep_na = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The dataset to be filtered.}

\item{keep_na}{Logical value indicating whether to keep observations where
the Ending is NA. If TRUE, observations where Ending is NA or "Normal" are kept.
If FALSE, only observations where Ending is "Normal" are kept (default is TRUE).}
}
\value{
A filtered dataset based on the specified criteria for the Ending status.
Additionally, it reports the number of observations before and after filtering,
as well as the number of observations filtered out.
}
\description{
\code{clean_ending} function is designed to filter a dataset
based on the status of the "Ending" variable. It allows users to either
include or exclude observations where the Ending is NA or explicitly marked
as "Normal". This function provides a simple yet effective method for focusing
analyses on subsets of data that meet specific criteria related to their
conclusion status.

\dontrun{
# Generate a dataset
df <- data.frame(ID = 1:5,
                 Score = c(100, 85, 90, NA, 95),
                 Ending = c("Normal", "Abnormal", NA, "Normal", "Critical"))

# Filter the dataset to keep only "Normal" or NA endings
filtered_df <- clean_ending(df, keep_na = TRUE)

# Filter the dataset to keep only "Normal" endings, excluding NAs
filtered_df_no_na <- clean_ending(df, keep_na = FALSE)

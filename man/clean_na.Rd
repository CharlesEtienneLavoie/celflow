\title{Clean Dataset Based on Missing Data Threshold and MCAR Test}
\usage{
clean_na(
  data,
  scenario_based_vars = NULL,
  missing_threshold = 60,
  full_names = FALSE,
  MCAR = FALSE,
  main_vars = NULL,
  answers_only = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The dataset to be cleaned.}

\item{scenario_based_vars}{Character vector with base names or full names
of variables to exclude from the dataset. Can also be a numeric vector with
column indices to be removed.}

\item{missing_threshold}{Percentage threshold for missing data per observation
(defaults to 60 percent).}

\item{full_names}{Logical value indicating whether \code{scenario_based_vars}
are full names of the variables (default is FALSE).}

\item{MCAR}{Logical value indicating whether to perform a MCAR test
(defaults to FALSE).}

\item{main_vars}{Character vector with base names of variables to include
in the MCAR test. If NULL, all variables are included (default is NULL).}

\item{answers_only}{Logical value indicating whether to exclude non-answer variables
(variables that do not contain a number nor 'demo' or 'Demo' in their name).
If TRUE, these variables are treated the same way as scenario-based variables.}
}
\value{
A dataset with cleaned missing data.
}
\description{
\code{clean_na} function is designed to handle missing data
in a given dataset by excluding variables and observations based on the
provided parameters. It provides a flexible and comprehensive approach to
handling missing data by allowing to exclude variables based on patterns
in their names and filter observations that have a percentage of missing
data above a specified threshold. Additionally, it can perform a MCAR (Missing
Completely At Random) test if requested.

# Generate some objects
df <- data.frame(a = c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5),
                 b = c("one", "two", "three", NA, "five"),
                 c = c(NA, NA, 3, 4, 5))

# Clean the environment but keep lists and the object named 'a'

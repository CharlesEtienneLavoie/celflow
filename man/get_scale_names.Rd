\title{Create Base Scale Names}
\usage{
get_scale_names(scale_list, min_parts = 3, parts_to_keep = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{scale_list}{A character vector with the names of the scales to be processed.}

\item{min_parts}{The minimum number of parts a scale must have to be included. Default is 3.}

\item{parts_to_keep}{The number of parts to keep for the base scale name. Default is 2.}
}
\value{
A character vector with the base scale names.
}
\description{
This function generates base scale names from a list of scales,
keeping only the first few parts of each scale name as specified by the user.
The scales are separated into parts by an underscore (_). Scales with fewer
parts than a specified minimum are filtered out.
}
\details{
For each scale in the scale list, the function splits the scale name
into parts based on the underscore (_). It keeps the first few parts as specified
by the user and combines them back into a base scale name. The base scale names are
then returned as a unique list.
}

# Assuming scales is your list of scales
